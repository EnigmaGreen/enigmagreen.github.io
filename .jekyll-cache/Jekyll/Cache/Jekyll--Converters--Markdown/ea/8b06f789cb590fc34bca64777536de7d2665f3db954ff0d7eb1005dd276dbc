<p>Antiseptix, a hypochlorous acid disinfectant product, has officially launched and is set to revolutionise the way we clean and sanitise our homes and workplaces.</p>

<p>Hypochlorous acid, the active ingredient in Antiseptix, is a naturally occurring solution that has been scientifically proven to be effective against a wide range of viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Unlike traditional disinfectants, Antiseptix is non-toxic, non-irritating, and safe for use around food, children, and pets.</p>

<p>Antiseptix is available in a convenient spray bottle and can be used on a variety of surfaces, including countertops, doorknobs, and even fabric. It dries quickly and leaves no residue, making it easy to use and perfect for on-the-go disinfection.</p>
